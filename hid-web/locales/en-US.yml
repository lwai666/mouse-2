  high_performance_warning_20k: Enabling 20K FPS will significantly increase power consumption and reduce battery life.
  high_performance_requirement: The current polling rate is below 4K, or Competitive Mode is not active. Enabling 20K FPS requires a higher data transmission rate. Due to the large data volume of 20K FPS, operating with an insufficient transmission rate may cause data overload, distortion, latency, and other instabilities. We have adjusted your polling rate to 4K. Please enable Competitive Mode before activating 20K FPS.
