  sports_arena_1: Enabling sports mode can enhance the competitive experience but will also increase power consumption!
  sports_arena_2: After enabling e-sports arena mode, more subtle hand movements and precise movements will be instantly reflected in the game. The responsiveness is twice that of e-sports mode, but it requires extremely high PC hardware specifications, strict wireless transmission environment, and more advanced wireless transmission devices. It will also result in higher power consumption!

  main_ui_description: Use presets or your own custom settings to adjust the mouse response speed and acceleration to fit your needs.
  sensitivity_preset_natural: Offers predictable cursor movement with an upper limit on maximum sensitivity.
  sensitivity_preset_jump: Uses low sensitivity for slow movements and instantly switches to high sensitivity for fast flicks.
  sensitivity_preset_jump1: The ideal choice for FPS players who prefer ultra-low sensitivity while still achieving 180-degree turns with excellent control during rapid movements.
  sensitivity_preset_custom: Your own dynamic sensitivity settings.
  high_performance_warning_20k: Enabling 20K FPS will significantly increase power consumption and reduce battery life.
  high_performance_requirement: The current polling rate is below 4K, or Competitive Mode is not active. Enabling 20K FPS requires a higher data transmission rate. Due to the large data volume of 20K FPS, operating with an insufficient transmission rate may cause data overload, distortion, latency, and other instabilities. We have adjusted your polling rate to 4K. Please enable Competitive Mode before activating 20K FPS.
